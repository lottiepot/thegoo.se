## Love Faviconique? Your support helps me keep creating!

Hey! It's me, Sven. Faviconique and my other plug-ins are passion projects released to the world for free. That said, donations are always welcome if you get value from my work.

[üí∏ Donate $10](https://dahlstrand.net/donate/) or any amount you're comfortable with. Thanks! üôè

## Here's what Faviconique can do

* üü¶ Solid color favicons
* ü¶ñ Emoji favicons (with an optional solid background color)
* üåô With support for dark mode

## Get started

Ready to give your blog a personal touch? Faviconique is available in the official directory and should be easy to install.

### Install the plug-in

1. Find [Faviconique in the plug-in directory](https://micro.blog/account/plugins/view/141).
2. Choose the site you want to install the plug-in to.
3. Press *Install*.
4. Congratulations! You've successfully installed the plug-in.

### Customize your favicon

1. Go to *Plug-ins* and press ‚öôÔ∏è *Settings* (next to the Faviconique plug-in).
2. Pick a *Background color*.
3. Type exactly one emoji into the *Emoji* text field.
4. Choose a *Dark mode background color* and *Dark mode emoji*.
5. Hit *Update Settings*.

Dark mode is optional; uncheck *Enable dark mode, please* if you prefer not to use it. The *Use transparent background for emoji* option does exactly what it says.

### Go check out your new favicon

When the settings are to your liking, visit your blog to see your new favicon. It may take a while, a couple of minutes or so, before it shows up. If it doesn't show, try making a hard refresh and emptying your browser cache.

## What about browser support?

Most browsers have full support for favicons, but there's one notable exception: Safari on Apple devices. People visiting your blog using Safari will always get a solid square with the color you've chosen.

| Browser 	| Solid color 	| Emoji 	| Dark mode 	|
|---------	|-------------	|-------	|-----------	|
| Firefox 	| ‚úÖ           	| ‚úÖ     	| ‚úÖ         	|
| Safari  	| ‚úÖ           	| ‚ùå     	| ‚ùå         	|
| Edge    	| ‚úÖ           	| ‚úÖ     	| ‚úÖ         	|
| Chrome  	| ‚úÖ           	| ‚úÖ     	| ‚úÖ         	|
